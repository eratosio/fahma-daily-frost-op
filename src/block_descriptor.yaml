  ### Notes:

    | Input Name | Input Example | Type    | Description   |
    |------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
    | geom       | POLYGON((145.87 -34.69,145.87 -34.64, 145.92 -34.64,145.92 -34.69,145.87 -34.69)) | WKT string of polygon or multipolygon      |Area of interest   |
    | start_date   | 2024-06-02        | string       | Start date in format YYYY-MM-DD|
    | end_date   | 2024-06-04        | string       | End date in format YYYY-MM-DD|
    | frost_threshold  | 1        | number       | Frost-hours threshold in degrees Celsius|
    | duration_threshold  | 1        | number       | Duration threshold in degrees Celsius|

    The input polygon of interest should have a total area smaller than 2000 sq.km. The date span should be less than 2 years, i.e. less than 730 days. 
  
    The Model returns 3 NetCDF Dataset, with the following values over the night of interest, derived from the Himawari8 Land Surface Temperature (LST) with real time calculated Clearnight Cloud Mask(V2):

    - Minimum Overnight Temperature (degrees Celsius): The lowest LST recorded during the night.
    - Duration Less than duration threshold (Hours): Total hours during the night where LST is below a user-defined duration threshold.
    - Frost Hours (Hours): Time-weighted cumulative hours where LST Ã— time < user-defined frost threshold. 
    
    With index:

    - lat: All latitude values within the range of polygon
    - lon: All longitude values within the range of polygon
    - time: Night window corresponding to the date of interest(i.e. Starting from 6pm of the date of interest)
    
    _FillValue: np.finfo(np.float32).max

    The output are Eratos gridded datasets, which can ideally be accessed via the API or SDK. Once the model completes its run successfully, the resource ERN will be available in the top right corner. But it also can be downloaded as a netcdf to read locally.
